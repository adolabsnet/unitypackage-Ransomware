# .unitypackage Ransomware

This is a proof of concept to encrypt files using a unitypackage.

**This script should not be used to encrypt other systems but should be used for study purposes.**

!!I assume no liability if you encrypt your files during testing!!

### Step-by-Step Guide to use the Script

* Download this Script
* Add the script to your future .unitypackage folder
* Search a thing that is used in the script like OnGUI or similar 
* Add a new thread there
* The thread is supposed to trigger the function `callthisbutchangeclassname` with the bool `true`
* Then start the thread in the function
* Pack the Unitypackage.

**This script uses a password for each file, so it is impossible to decrypt them**
